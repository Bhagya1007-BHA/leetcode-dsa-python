Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9, return [0, 1].


# python code 
def twoSum(nums, target):
    map = {}
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        complement = target - nums[i]
        if complement in map:
            return [map[complement], i]
        map[nums[i]] = i
    raise ValueError("No two sum solution")
